\item \textbf{*Problem 3.59 (Closure).}
  A set $\mathcal{S}$ is closed under an operation if performing that
  operation on elements of $\mathcal{S}$ returns an element in $\mathcal{S}$.
  Here are five examples of closure.

  \begin{center}
  $\mathcal{S}$ is closed under addition $\imp$
  $\forall(x,y)\in\mathcal{S}^2: x+y\in\mathcal{S}$.

  $\mathcal{S}$ is closed under subtraction $\imp$
  $\forall(x,y)\in\mathcal{S}^2: x-y\in\mathcal{S}$.

  $\mathcal{S}$ is closed under multiplication $\imp$
  $\forall(x,y)\in\mathcal{S}^2: xy\in\mathcal{S}$.

  $\mathcal{S}$ is closed under division $\imp$
  $\forall(x,y\ne 0)\in\mathcal{S}^2: x/y\in\mathcal{S}$.

  $\mathcal{S}$ is closed under exponentiation $\imp$
  $\forall(x,y)\in\mathcal{S}^2: x^y\in\mathcal{S}$.
  \end{center}

\item \textbf{*Problem 4.10(k-l).}
  You may assume $n$ is an integer.
  Prove by contraposition (explicitly state the contrapositive).
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \setcounter{enumi}{10}
  \item 3 divides $n-2\imp n$ is not a perfect square.
  \item If $p>2$ is prime, then $p^2+1$ is composite.
  \end{enumerate}

  \subsection*{(k) P(x) : (p)3 divides $n-2\imp n$ (q)is not a perfect square.}
  
  Claim : If 3 divides n - 2, then n is not a perfect square

  Contrapositive: Assume that n is a perfect square, then 3 does not divide n - 2

  If n is a perfect square, then n = \(k^2\) for some $k\in\Z$ .

  Now consider n - 2 in (3 divides n - 2), plug in \(k^2\) for n

  n - 2 = \( k^2\) - 2

  Now we want to show that 3 does not divide \(k^2\) - 2. In order for \(k^2\) to be divisble by 3, \((k^2-2)\%3\) has to equal 0. Consider 3 cases, k=0, k=1, and k=2.

  k = 0, \(k^2 = 0\), \(k^2-2=-2\), \(-2 \% 3 = 1\), remainder of 1 when divided by 3, not divisible by 3
  
  k = 1, \(k^2 = 1\), \(k^2-2=-1\), \(-1 \% 3 = 2\), remainder of 2 when divided by 3, not divisibly by 3

  k = 2, \(k^2 = 4\), \(k^2-2=2\), \(2 \% 3 = 1\), remainder of 1 when divided by 3, not divisible by 3

  In all cases, we see that \((k^2-2)\%3\) does not equal to 0, none of these cases are divisible by 3

  We have proven that when n is a perfect square, then 3 does not divide n - 2, making 3 divides n - 2 false

  Thus we have shown that p is false and P(x) is true.

  \subsection*{(l) P(x) : (p) If p $>$ 2 is prime, (q) then \(p^2+1\) is composite}
  
  Contrapositive: Assume that \(p^2+1\) is not composite, then p $>$ 2 is not prime or \(p \leq 2\) 

  When \(p^2+1\) is not composite, it is either prime or a negative number, let's consider both cases

  

\vspace{0.1in}

\item \textbf{Problem 4.11.}
  For $x,y\in\N$, which statements below are contradictions (cannot possibly be true).
  Explain.
%  \begin{multicols}{2}
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item $x^2<y$.
  \item $x^2=y/2$.
  \item $x^2-y^2\le 1$.
  \item $x^2+y^2\le 1$.
  \item $2x+1=y^2+5y$.
  \item $x^2-y^2/2=1$.
  \item $x^2-y^2=1$.
  \end{enumerate}
%  \end{multicols}

\vspace{0.1in}

\item \textbf{Problem 4.14.}
  Prove: If $a,b,c\in\Z$ are odd, then for all $x\in\Q$,
  $ax^2+bx+c\ne 0$.
  (Contradiction in a direct proof.)

\newpage

%\item \textbf{Problem 4.16.}

\item \textbf{Problem 4.47 (Without Loss of Generality (wlog)).}
  Consider the following claim.
  \begin{center}
  If $x$ and $y$ have opposite parity (one is odd and one is even),
  then $x+y$ is odd.
  \end{center}
  Explain why, in a direct proof, we may assume that $x$ is odd and $y$ is even?
  Prove the claim.
  (Such a proof starts ``Without loss of generality, assume $x$ is odd and $y$ is even.
  Then, $\ldots$'')

\vspace{0.1in}

\item \textbf{Problem 4.48(c).}
  Use the concept of ``without loss of generality'' to prove these claims.
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \setcounter{enumi}{2}
  \item For any non-zero real number $x$, $x^2+1/x^2\ge 2$.
  \end{enumerate}

\vspace{0.1in}

%\item \textbf{Problem 5.10.}

\item \textbf{*Problem 5.12(d).}
  For $n\ge 1$, prove by induction:
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \setcounter{enumi}{3}
  \item $3^n>n^2$.
  \end{enumerate}

  \subsection*{(d) P(n) : \(3^n > n^2\)}
  We use induction prove $\forall(n \geq 1)$ : P(n)
  
  [Base Case] $P(1) = 3^1 > 1^2 = 3 > 1$ which is True

  [induction Step] Prove $P(n) \imp P(n+1)$ for all n $\geq$ 1 

  Specifically, if $3^n > n^2$, then $3^{n+1} > (n+1)^2$

  Now we want to prove $3^{n+1} > (n+1)^2$

  By Induction Assumption, we know that $3^n > n^2$

  Which allows us to multiply both sides by 3, giving us $3^{n+1} > 3n^2$, looking at the LHS, we can subsitute it in our next inequality

  Simplify $(n+1)^2$ gives us $ n^2 + 2n +1$
  
  Subsitute everything into this next inequality so we can compare, we get

  $3^{n+1} > 3n^2 > n^2 + 2n + 1$

  We know that $3k^2$ is greater than the highest term in the most RHS's quadratic $n^2$ and that $3^{n+1} > 3n^2$ due to the induction hypothesis. 

  We can rewrite the inequality as $3^{n+1} > n^2 + 2n + 1$ which is equal/the same to what we wanted to prove, $3^{n+1} > (n+1)^2$, up in the 4th line
  
  Thus, by induction, we have proved P(n+1) to be true, making P(n) to be true for all cases $n \geq 1$

\vspace{0.1in}

\item \textbf{*Problem 5.20.}
  Prove, by induction, that every $n\ge 1$ is a sum of distinct powers of~2.

\vspace{0.1in}

\item \textbf{*Problem 5.39.}
  Prove you can make any postage greater than 12\textcent\
  using only 4\textcent\  and 5\textcent\  stamps.
  (The USPS can set any postage above 12\textcent\  and you don't have to buy any new stamps.)

\vspace{0.1in}

\item \textbf{Problem 6.3(a).}
  Strengthen the claim and prove by induction for $n\ge 1$:
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item The sum of the first $n$ odd numbers is a square.
    [Hint: Strengthen to a specific square.]
  \end{enumerate}

\vspace{0.1in}

\item \textbf{*Problem 6.8.}
  Prove $n^7<2^n$ for $n\ge 37$.
  (a)~Use induction.
  (b)~Use leaping induction.

\vspace{0.1in}

\item \textbf{Problem 6.15.}
  Prove that there are $2^{\lceil n/2\rceil}$ distinct $n$-bit binary palindromes
  (strings that equal their reversal).

\vspace{0.1in}

\item \textbf{Problem 6.32.}
  We are back in $L$-tile land.
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item This time, the potted plant needs more room than just one square.
    For $n\ge 1$, a $2^n\times 2^n$ grid-patio is missing a (large) $2\times 2$ square
    in a corner as shown in the figure.
    Prove that the remainder of the patio can be $L$-tiled, for $n\ge 1$.
  \item We are no longer sure what the size of the potted plant is.
    The size may be $2^k\times 2^k$, and so a $2^k\times 2^k$ square
    will be missing from the corner of the $2^n\times 2^n$ grid-patio.
    Prove that the remainder of the patio can always be $L$-tiled,
    for $k\ge 1$ and $n\ge k$.
    [Hint: Tinker: try $k=2$; $n=3$ and $k=2$; $n=4$ to figure out what is going on.]
  \end{enumerate}

\newpage

\item \textbf{*Problem 6.43.}
  A sliding puzzle is a grid of 9 squares with 8 tiles.
  The goal is to get the 8 tiles into order (the target configuration).
  A move slides a tile into an empty square.
  Below, we show first a row move, then a column move.

  Prove that no sequence of moves produces the target configuration.
  [Hint: The tiles form a sequence going left to right, top to bottom.
  An inversion is a pair that is out of order.
  Prove by induction that the number of inversions stays odd.]

\vspace{0.1in}

\item \textbf{Problem 7.3.}
  Give a recursive definition of the function $f(n)=n!\times 2^n$, where $n\ge 1$.

\vspace{0.1in}

\item \textbf{Problem 7.4(a-c).}
  Guess a formula for $A_n$ and prove it by induction.
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item $A_0=0$ and $A_n=A_{n-1}+1$ for $n\ge 1$.
  \item $A_1=1$, $A_2=2$, and $A_n=A_{n-1}+2A_{n-2}$ for $n\ge 2$.
  \item $A_0=1$; $A_1=2$; $A_n=2A_{n-1}-A_{n-2}+2$ for $n\ge 2$.
    [Hint: Method of differences.]
